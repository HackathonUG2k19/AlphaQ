# AnnounceIIIT

AlphaQ's submission for HackathonUG2k19. A "noticeboard" application to keep you updated in the circles you care about. It is way more streamlined than other current solutions and only gives you the data that you need.;
Let's you

- Add new Announcement Rooms
- Give room specific announcement only
- Makes you more focused ðŸ™‡

## Running the Application

Clone the repo, then run

```
cd AlphaQ
npm install
npm start
```

To run the server

## Future Features

- Converting it into a mobile app
- Enabling Push Notifications for the rooms the user is a part of
- Vote Poll on events, people interested and not interested
- Something this basic can be integrated well with IIIT (using CAS) because not everyone checks facebook on daily basis
