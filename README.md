# AnnounceIT

AlphaQ's submission for HackathonUG2k19. A "noticeboard" application to keep you updated in the circles you care about.
Let's you

- Add new Announcement Rooms
- Give room specific announcement only
- Makes you more focused ðŸ™‡

## Running the Application

Clone the repo, then run

```
cd AlphaQ
npm install
npm start
```

To run the server

## Some features to add

- Once Joined a room, <button>Join room</button> should change to <button>Joined</button>
- Sign In / Sign Out -> selective viewership only
- Maybe have some admin acceses like moderator settings
- While writing event descriptions, the line is cut off short too quickly
- Redirection to room's page after adding an event
- That's all
